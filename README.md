Appendices Hub

Operational & Technical Companion to the Boundary OS Framework

Overview

This Appendix Hub serves as the operational backbone of the Boundary OS research ecosystem.
While the core papers establish theory, logic, and policy implications, the appendices provide implementation-grade artifacts: specifications, datasets, simulation designs, figures, and governance scaffolding.

Together, these appendices demonstrate that Boundary OS is not only conceptual, but executable.

Relationship to Core Papers

Each appendix explicitly maps back to one or more core papers:

Boundary OS: Redesigning Security, Diplomacy, and Agency in the Age of AI
→ System architecture, mediation rules, and governance logic

Boundary Stability Index (BSI): Measuring Adaptive Resilience in Complex Societies
→ Quantitative index, datasets, mathematical specification, and simulation

This hub clarifies what belongs where, and how readers, policymakers, and engineers should navigate the materials.

Appendix Structure
📁 Appendix F — Implementation Resources & Technical Annex

Primary Reference: Boundary OS / BSI

Appendix F collects technical, mathematical, and design-level resources required to implement, test, or simulate Boundary OS systems.

Contents include:

F.1–F.4
System architecture diagrams, boundary state machine logic, data flow specifications

F.5–F.8
AI mediation constraints, negative protocols, auditability requirements

F.9 — Boundary Stability Index (BSI)
A dedicated sub-appendix focusing on:

Mathematical formulation of BSI

Layer-wise computation (L1–L5)

Weighting, thresholds, and normalization

Synthetic datasets (v0.1)

Policy simulation interfaces

👉 See: appendices/F/README.md

📄 Appendix F.9 — Boundary Stability Index (BSI)

Primary Reference: BSI Paper
Secondary Reference: Boundary OS (operational feedback)

Appendix F.9 is treated as a standalone technical annex, equivalent in rigor to a methods section of a quantitative paper.

It includes:

Formal mathematical specification

Dataset schema and variable definitions

Example calculations (EU migration cases, synthetic data)

KPI integration back into policy evaluation

Links to the BSI Simulator UI

👉 See: appendices/F/F9-BSI/README.md

📁 Appendix G — National & Trilateral Implementation Blueprints

Primary Reference: Boundary OS (Policy & Diplomacy)

Appendix G translates Boundary OS theory into nation-scale execution plans.

Current focus:

Singapore Pilot Hub

Trilateral Cooperation: Singapore–Taiwan–Estonia

AI-mediated diplomacy, cyber resilience, and crisis response

Government-report-grade timelines, budgets, and KPIs

Appendix G is designed so that it can function independently as a policy proposal, even when detached from the main paper.

Design Philosophy of the Appendices

Executable, not illustrative
Every figure, table, and formula is designed to be implementable.

AI non-dominance preserved
All technical artifacts enforce human override and prohibit automated judgment at narrative/social layers.

Layer consistency
All measurements, simulations, and dashboards align with the Five-Layer Model (Material → Social).

Boundary OS is not a doctrine.
It is an operating system for adaptive coexistence.
