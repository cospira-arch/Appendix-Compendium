Appendix Compendium

Boundary OS — Technical, Mathematical, and Policy Annexes

This appendix repository serves as the operational backbone of the Boundary OS research program.
While the main papers establish theoretical foundations and policy implications, the appendices provide executable, inspectable, and extensible artifacts demonstrating that Boundary OS is not merely conceptual, but implementable across institutional scales.

Purpose of This Appendix

The appendices are designed to fulfill four functions:

Reproducibility
Enable researchers and policymakers to trace assumptions, metrics, and algorithms.

Operationalization
Translate theory into planning tools, datasets, simulation interfaces, and governance templates.

Policy Transferability
Allow adaptation across domains (migration, diplomacy, AI governance) and regions (EU, ASEAN, city-level pilots).

Auditability & Trust
Make Boundary OS transparent by design—especially regarding AI’s non-dominant mediation role.

Appendix Structure Overview
📘 Appendix F — Implementation Resources & Technical Annex

Focus: How Boundary OS works in practice

Section	Title	Description
F.1	System Architecture Overview	Modular Boundary OS architecture
F.2	Data Ingestion & Sensing Pipelines	Tremor detection inputs (material → affective)
F.3	Boundary State Machine	State transitions & tuning logic
F.4	AI Mediation Constraints	Negative Protocol & human override rules
F.5	Visualization Interfaces	Dashboards & policy-facing UI logic
F.6	Simulation Scenarios	If–then policy intervention models
F.7	Cross-Border Deployment Templates	Trilateral / multilateral reuse
F.8	Ethical & Legal Compliance Mapping	EU AI Act, ADM audits
F.9	Boundary Stability Index (BSI)	Quantitative–qualitative hybrid metric
F.x	Mathematical Specification of BSI	Formal definitions, weights, thresholds

👉 Appendix F is implementation-first and directly supports policymakers, engineers, and auditors.

Final Thoughts

Boundaries are not walls to defend, but membranes to tune.
This appendix exists so that Boundary OS can be tested, questioned, improved, and trusted.
